 * taking once the last one has come back.
 *
 * The readout must cost less than the budget it reports. At one reading a
 * second with ten frames timed per reading, it was the idle load: ten forced
 * composites, a process walk in the backend and a re-render every second
 * came to 0.8 % of a core in the app and 2.6 % in the webview against a
 * budget of 0.5 % (measured on a compiled 0.5.1 with the library loaded).
 * So: a reading every four seconds, and the frame rate from two frames
 * rather than ten — the interval between two consecutive frames is the
 * refresh period, which is all ten frames were averaging.
