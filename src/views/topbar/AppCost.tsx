 * What the app is costing, in the title bar's corner.

 * Its own component so that a reading re-renders these three figures and
 * nothing else: as a value of the shell it re-rendered the whole window
 * every time, which was most of the webview's idle load.
 *
 * A dash is a figure the platform will not give rather than a zero, which
 * would be a claim. GPU is not among them: macOS accounts it per process
 * only to root, so it was always a dash.
