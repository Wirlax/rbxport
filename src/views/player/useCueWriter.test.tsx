/**
 * @vitest-environment jsdom
 *
 * The one-write-at-a-time guard, and what the interface is told when a write
 * fails.
 *
 * The guard is not a nicety: a held key repeats about thirty times a second,
 * and every repeat used to reach the backend as another cue at the same point
 * before the first had come back. So the test that matters is the one that
 * fires several presses inside a single frame and expects the backend to have
 * heard one. The error wording matters for the same reason the guard does —
 * the deck shows whatever comes out of `describe`, so a failure with no usable
 * message has to end up as a sentence rather than `[object Object]`.
