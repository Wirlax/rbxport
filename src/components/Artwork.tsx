/**
 * A track's sleeve, which shows nothing at all until it has one.
 *
 * An `<img>` whose source has not arrived is not empty: WebKit draws its own
 * broken-file glyph in it, and `alt=""` does not suppress that — only the alt
 * *text*. At startup every visible row asks for artwork before the library is
 * open, so the first screen was a grid of question marks over the hue tint.
 *
 * So the image is hidden until it has actually decoded, and the ground behind
 * it is left to the caller: a track with artwork shows an empty square while
 * it loads rather than a placeholder that is about to be replaced.
 *
 * The retry is what makes that safe. A request made before the library is open
 * fails, and an `<img>` never asks again on its own — the row would stay blank
 * for as long as it stayed on screen, which is worse than the glyph. A handful
 * of attempts covers the second the library takes to come up; past that the
 * file really is unreadable and the tint stands in for good.
