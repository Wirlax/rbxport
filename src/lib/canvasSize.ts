/**
 * How big a canvas's backing store should be for the space it occupies.
 *
 * A canvas stretched by CSS from a fixed backing store is blurry on a wide
 * window and wasteful on a narrow one, so the store follows the element. Two
 * things stop that being expensive:
 *
 * - the width is quantised, so dragging the window edge reallocates the buffer
 *   a handful of times rather than once per pixel;
 * - the device pixel ratio is capped, because past 2× the extra samples are
 *   not visible in a 14-pixel-high waveform and the buffer grows with the
 *   square of the ratio.

 * Guards against a runaway layout asking for a buffer megabytes wide.

 * The hardware's own limit, not a budget: 4096 looked generous until the
 * detail waveform, which draws `OVERDRAW` spans at up to 2x, asked for
 * 6,028 device pixels on the reference 1800pt window and got 4,096 stretched
 * across them. A canvas scaled up by 1.47 turns the one-pixel bars into a
 * smear, which reads as the waveform losing its colour. Every engine we ship
 * on takes 16,384 in one dimension.
