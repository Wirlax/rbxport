//! The Preferences window.
//!
//! rekordbox opens Preferences as a window of its own, with a title bar to
//! drag it by, beside the main one; so does this. It loads the same bundle
//! at `index.html#preferences/<pane>`, which the frontend renders as the
//! Preferences alone. The two windows share `localStorage`, so a choice made
//! here reaches the main window through its `storage` event.

// not be hidden because there was no webview under it). An async command
// runs on a worker instead, and the main thread is free to finish the job.
// Tauri hands the handle and the argument over by value; the command owns both.
