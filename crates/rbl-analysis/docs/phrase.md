# Phrases

Two different things go by this name: phrase starts, which the crate
finds, and phrase labels, which it does not.

## Phrase starts

Where sections begin: the downbeats at which the music changes most over
the four bars either side. They come out of the downbeat stage
([downbeat.md](downbeat.md)) and are used by the key rules that read the
bass at the start of a phrase.

    A[novelty per half beat<br/>at the 4-bar scale] --> B[local maxima]
    B --> C{on a downbeat,<br/>and at least 30 % of the<br/>strongest peak?}
    C -- yes --> D[phrase start]
    C -- no --> E[ignored]
```

A track has about six of them. They are times in seconds, in order, in
`GridPhase::phrase_starts`, and are passed to key detection as
`KeyGrid::phrase_starts`.

## Phrase labels (not implemented)

Rekordbox's `PSSI` tag labels each section: intro, verse, bridge, chorus,
up, down, outro. There is no open implementation to compare against, and a
wrong label is something a DJ sees mid-set. So `phrase.rs` declares the
shape (`PhraseAnalyzer`, `Phrase`, `PhraseKind`) with an `Unimplemented`
stub that returns `None`, and the ANLZ writer leaves the tag out rather
than write invented structure. The same goes for vocal detection (`PVDI`,
`vocal.rs`).

If labels are built, the phrase starts above are the section boundaries
to label.
