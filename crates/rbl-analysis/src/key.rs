//! Musical key by chromagram plus profile matching.
//!
//! Spectral energy is folded onto the twelve pitch classes, then correlated
//! against major and minor profiles. The best of the 24 rotations is the key.
//!
//! The front end is what decides the result, and two things about it were
//! measured to matter more than any profile:
//!
//! - **Energy, not counts.** An earlier version added `ln(1 + |X|)` for every
//!   bin near a semitone, which made a pitch class's total mostly the number
//!   of bins that happen to round to it — a fixed pattern that read most of
//!   the golden playlist as C minor. A bin contributes its magnitude, and
//!   only in proportion to how close it sits to a semitone.
//! - **Harmonics fold down.** A note at f also puts energy at 2f, 3f, 4f…,
//!   which land on other pitch classes (the fifth, the major third) and pull
//!   the answer a fifth away. Each bin also credits the classes of f/2, f/3,
//!   f/4 with decaying weight, so a note's harmonics vote for the note.
//!
//! The profile match is then handed to a **rule pipeline** ([`Rule`]): named
//! corrections, each with its own knobs, applied in order to the ranked
//! candidates. The rules are the ones set out in `rules.md` — a toss-up
//! goes to the minor; when the match is close, the bass in the intro, the
//! outro and on the downbeats names the tonic — and the golden rig reports,
//! per rule, how often it fired, what it fixed and what it broke, so a new
//! rule is judged the same way as a new profile.
//!
//! Every front-end choice is a field of [`KeyOptions`] so the golden rig
//! can search them; the defaults are what scored best on the golden
//! playlist.
