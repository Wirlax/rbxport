//! Playing a track faster or slower without moving its pitch.

//! Behind a trait, deliberately. The plan defers which library does this until
//! distribution, because the good ones disagree about licensing — Rubber Band
//! R3 is GPL-or-commercial, signalsmith-stretch is MIT, Bungee is MPL-2.0 —
//! and a choice made behind `Stretcher` costs a file to change rather than a
//! rewrite. What is here is a WSOLA backend written for this crate: enough to
//! measure the CPU cost of two decks stretching at once, which the plan wants
//! settled before the licence question is even asked, and enough to hear.
//!
//! WSOLA is overlap-add with the overlap put where the waveform agrees with
//! itself. Cutting a segment out at a fixed hop and crossfading it against the
//! last one puts two pieces of a periodic signal together at whatever phase
//! they happen to be at, and on anything tonal that is a warble. Searching a
//! few milliseconds either side for the offset that best matches what came
//! before costs one correlation a hop and removes most of it.
