//! Seeking on every pointer move gives you the *right place* and the wrong

//! backwards, and stops making a sound when the hand stops.
//!
//! What this was measured at when it was judged to sound right, and which test

//!
//! So: a window of decoded audio around the cursor, and a read head that moves
//! through it at the drag's own rate. Both halves are here and neither knows
//! about threads — the decode thread fills the window, and calls `render` to
//! produce a block.
//!
//! A hand that pauses is a stop like any other, so the same envelope guards it:
//! cutting to silence the moment the head rests is a step from wherever the
//! waveform happened to be, and on bass that is a crack every time the hand
//! holds still. See `fade`.
