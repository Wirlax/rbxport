# rbl-deck

[Project documentation](../../docs/README.md) · [Architecture](../../docs/development/architecture.md)

This crate owns two-deck playback: decoding, transport, the audio callback,
mixing, stretching, scrubbing, and the clocks read by the interface. It has no
Tauri dependency. The app integrates it through `src-tauri/src/player.rs`.

## Start here

1. Read the public API and thread model in [`src/lib.rs`](src/lib.rs).
2. Follow the [code map](#code-map) for the behavior you are changing.
3. Read [Scrubbing](../../docs/user/waveform-scrubbing.md) for its filter contract.
4. Use the [validation guide](docs/testing.md) and [fixture guide](tests/fixtures/README.md).
5. Follow the project [conventions](../../docs/development/conventions.md) and [contribution process](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Thread model

The control side sends commands and reads clocks. Each deck's decode thread
owns file I/O, decoding, and resampling. The audio callback reads ring-buffer
blocks, mixes them, fills missing audio with silence, and publishes positions.
Blocks carry generation information so seeking can discard stale decoded data.

Keep blocking work and locks out of the callback. The steady-state allocation
test counts allocations after callback initialization; do not move file access,
format decoding, or control-thread work into that path.

## Code map

| Code | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `lib.rs` | Engine API, render callback, master state, and integration. |
| `deck.rs`, `block.rs` | Deck commands, decode workers, and queued audio blocks. |
| `decode.rs` | Streaming decode, seek alignment, and resampling. |
| `clock.rs`, `health.rs` | Position/snapshot and audio-health state. |
| `sink.rs` | Device and caller-supplied sink interfaces. |
| `mixer.rs`, `limiter.rs`, `meter.rs` | Channel processing, output limiting, and meters. |
| `stretch.rs`, `rubberband.rs` | Varispeed, WSOLA, and optional Rubber Band processing. |
| `scrub.rs`, `fade.rs`, `smooth.rs` | Scrub audio and continuous transport/control changes. |
| `metronome.rs` | Grid-based click generation. |

`Engine::new` opens the default device; `Engine::on_device` selects a device.
`Engine::with_sink` supplies a test sink, so tests can exercise the render
callback without opening physical hardware. See `tests/engine.rs` for usage.

## Build features and limits

The default `rubberband` feature builds the vendored Rubber Band library.
Without it, playback uses the WSOLA fallback and does not offer accurate key
shifting. See [Licensing](../../LICENSING.md) for the bundled component terms.
The crate is a two-deck engine; do not imply four-deck behavior from a firmware
model exposing more players.

Generated-audio tests check the engine and DSP. A physical output-device run
and a player-firmware run are separate evidence layers.
