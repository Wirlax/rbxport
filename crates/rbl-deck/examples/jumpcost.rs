//! How long a jump takes to be heard. READ-ONLY.
//!
//! "Jumping from the start to near the end hesitates" is a claim about the
//! time between asking for a position and hearing it. This measures exactly
//! that: it pulls the sink in real time the way a device callback does, asks
//! for a position, and counts the buffers that come back silent before the
//! audio of the new position arrives.
//!
//! Distance is the variable. A jump forward by a second lands in what the
//! decoder has already read; a jump to the far end of a file is a demuxer seek
//! and a decoder reset, and that is the one that is supposed to hesitate.
//!
//! `cargo run --release -p rbl-deck --example jumpcost -- <audio file>`
